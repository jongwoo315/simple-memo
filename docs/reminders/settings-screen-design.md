# Reminder: Settings Screen Design

**Date:** 2026-01-18

## Status
Current design is acceptable but not ideal.

## Current Design
- Uppercase titles (THEME, SYNC) with 18px font, light weight, letter spacing
- Options separated by pipes: `system | light | dark`
- Layout: `TITLE    option | option | option`

## Feedback
- Title styling improved but user still not fully satisfied
- Needs further design iteration

## TODO
- [ ] Revisit Settings screen design in a future update
- [ ] Consider alternative layouts or visual treatments
